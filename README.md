# Jeopardy_Game
A game of jeopardy! Only backwards.

This program will create a backwards jeopardy game. It is intended to be run on visual studios. To install create a project in visual studios, download all the files in to the project folder. Then add all the .h files to the header section, all the .cpp files to the source section and everything else to the resource section. If the html index page doesn’t open automatically, go in to the project file and open it and play some jeopardy. 

This program was originally created for my data structures class. It works by reading the information in a csv file, storing it in a linked list and running it through several custom classes (field then question) to format it to a webpage.  Because this was originally for a class there are a fair number of functions that aren’t used in the final project. Since their not hurting anything I have decided to leave them in so if I want to expand the funcanalty later its east to do so.
